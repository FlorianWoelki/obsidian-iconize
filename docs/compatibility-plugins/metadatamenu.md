Iconize and Metadatamenu work together, but you need to tweak a few options,
if you want to use [frontmatter](../files-and-folders/use-frontmatter) and
want to [see recommendations](../notes/icons-in-notes) when you want to
insert a new icon in your markdown.

First, according to this
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-iconize/issues/389)
you need to adjust the frontmatter field name to something else like
`iconizeIcon`.

This will allow you to use frontmatter in your markdown files.

To [see recommendations](../notes/icons-in-notes) when you want to insert a new
icon in your markdown, you also need to adjust the icon identifier which
normally starts with `:` to something else than `:`.

This will allow you to see recommendations when you want to insert a new icon
in your markdown.
