# Unicode issue

If you found some weird characters in your text, it's probably because of the
encoding. The reason for this issue is most likely that Emojis are turned off
which just removes all the Emojis in your text.

You can enable emojis by following [this guide](../guide/icon-packs.html#using-emojis). This should most likely resolve
the issue.
