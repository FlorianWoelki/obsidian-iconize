# Getting Started

This obsidian plugin allows you to add **any** custom icon (of type `.svg`) or from an
icon pack to anything you want in your Vault. This can be a file, a folder, in a title, or
even in a paragraph of your notes.

## Installation

For installing the plugin, you can either install it from the community plugins or download
the latest release from the
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-iconize/releases/).

This was all you need to do to install the plugin. Now you can start using it.

## Usage

Using the plugin is really straightforward. Obviously, Iconize has a lot of other features,
but the most important one is to add icons to your files or folders.

First of all, you need an icon pack. You can either use one of the predefined icon packs or
add your own. For adding your own, please read the documentation about
<a href="/guide/icon-packs#custom-icon-packs">custom icon packs</a>.

For adding a predefined icon pack, you can go to the settings of the plugin and select
`Browse icon packs` and then select the icon pack you want to use.

After installing the icon pack, you just need to *right-click* on a file or folder and 
then select the option `Change Icon`. This will open a modal where you can select the
icon you want to use.
